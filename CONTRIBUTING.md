## 🚀 Local Development
### Prerequisites
> **Note:** Ensure you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) installed before proceeding with local development.

### Install dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```


### Run local environment

```bash
pnpm start
```

This will:

- Launch kernel and runtime services
- Simulate core Deepnote runtime behavior

## 🧪 Testing

TBD – coming soon.

## 🧼 Code Style

We use:

- **TypeScript**
