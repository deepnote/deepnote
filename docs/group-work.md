Deepnote is a fantastic platform for group work because it combines the power of a collaborative code editor with the convenience of a cloud-based workspace. This means multiple students can work on the same project simultaneously without worrying about version control or merging conflicts.

Deepnote's intuitive interface makes it easy for everyone to get up to speed quickly, regardless of their level of experience with programming. It also offers a wide range of features to help streamline the collaborative process, such as real-time code execution and sharing, customizable workspaces, and seamless integration with popular tools and services.

## Setup

Each group project can be shared with multiple students working on the assignment together. The easiest way to share the assignment with multiple students is to go to the project, click on the share button, select the desired access level, and distribute the link among the students in the group.<br />
