Deepnote supports real-time collaboration. When team members [join your project](/docs/share-projects), you'll see their avatar appear in the top right. You and your team are now sharing the same execution environment at the same time.

<Callout status="info">

In order to prevent inadvertent code changes, two collaborators cannot write into the same block at the same time.
