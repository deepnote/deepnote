Every workspace in Deepnote has free machine hours that replenish every month. If you need additional machine hours or more powerful machines, you can always upgrade your hardware.

###### **What are machine hours?**

When you run your notebooks, we use cloud-based hardware to execute your code. Machine hours are the total amount of hours our hardware was running to execute this code.

###### **How many machine hours are offered for free?**

Our goal is to provide an unlimited number of free machine hours for all workspaces. However, in certain cases we might limit a workspaceâ€™s compute hours when we detect irregular activity or extremely high usage. In case this happens, we will be in touch with you.

###### **How can I add more machine hours?**

In the rare occasion that a workspace exceeds the free machine hours we provide, workspaces on the Team and Enterprise plans can purchase additional machine hours. The hourly cost of these machines can be found in the Machines menu.

###### **How can I upgrade to more RAM or CPU?**

Workspaces on the Team and Enterprise plans can choose to switch to stronger machines, with higher computation power and RAM. The hourly cost of these machines can be found in the Machines menu.

###### **How much will I be charged for machines?**

If you decide to purchase machine hours beyond the free machine hours we provide, you will be charged at an hourly rate, calculated on a per-minute basis. So if you use a machine that costs $1/hr for 30 minutes, you will be charged $0.50. You can find the hourly rates for each machine in the Machines menu.
