Deepnote gives you a user-friendly platform to help explore, learn, and work with other data science and machine learning students. With a clean, intuitive interface and helpful features, such as code completion and syntax highlighting, our platform makes it easy to get started on your projects.

Deepnote also allows you to collaborate on projects in real time, making it a great tool for group projects and study groups. And since it's built on top of Jupyter notebooks, you have access to a vast ecosystem of libraries and tools for data science and machine learning, allowing you to tackle more complex projects and tasks.

Best of all, Deepnote is free to use (though it also offers paid plans with additional features for those who need them).
