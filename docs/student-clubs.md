Deepnote is easy to use and has several features that make it an ideal option for students and researchers, including:

#### Collaboration

Deepnote allows multiple users to work on the same project at the same time, which makes it a great tool for group projects and collaborative research.

#### Code and markdown cells

Deepnote offers a variety of cells that can be used to write and run code, as well as format and document your work using markdown. This makes it easy to write, execute, and document your data science projects.

#### Integration with popular tools

Deepnote integrates with popular data science libraries and tools, such as NumPy, Pandas, and TensorFlow, making it easy to use these tools in your projects.

#### Data visualization

Deepnote has built-in support for data visualization using popular libraries, such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly. You can easily create and customize plots and charts.

#### Cloud hosting

Deepnote is cloud-based, which means you can access your projects from any device with an internet connection. This makes it a convenient tool for students who may not have access to a powerful desktop or laptop.

## Use cases

#### Club projects

Thanks to Deepnote's [collaborative nature](https://deepnote.com/docs/real-time-collaboration), your club members can share their findings via one link and have direct access to all projects at any time. Additionally, you can use Deepnote's [publishing feature](https://deepnote.com/docs/publish-projects) while presenting your findings.

#### Learning curriculum

You can use Deepnote to host your learning materials for the entire student club. Thanks to its organizational structure and different access levels, you can invite your entire club to learn about different data science topics, as well as allow them to duplicate the projects and work on their own.
