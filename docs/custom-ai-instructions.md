Custom AI Instructions is a new feature in Deepnote that allows you to personalize how Deepnote AI responds to your queries. These instructions are user-specific and provide a way to customize the AI's behavior according to your preferences.

## **Accessing custom instructions**

1. Navigate to Settings > Account (or go to your workspace settings and click on the "Account" tab)
2. Look for the AI custom instructions input field
3. Enter your desired instructions
4. Click "Update" to save your changes

## **Key features**

- **Personal customization**: Custom instructions are specific to your account and are not shared with your team members
- **Persistent behavior**: Once set, the instructions will apply to all your interactions with Deepnote AI across notebooks
- **Flexible configuration**: You can modify instructions to specify:
  - Preferred plotting libraries (e.g., Seaborn)
  - Response formatting
  - Interaction style
  - Code styling preferences
  - Or just making your docstrings sounds uwu

## **Example use case**

Let's look at a practical example:

**Without custom Instructions:**

- When asked to plot data, DeepnoteAI uses default plotting libraries
- Responses follow standard formatting

**With custom instructions:**

# Example instruction:

"When you're going to be plotting multiple charts, always use plotly and subplots to plot them in one output. Also I want all of the charts to be green!"

### **Best practices**

1. Be specific about your preferences
2. Consider including:
   - Preferred libraries and frameworks
   - Coding style guidelines(suggested to refer to PEP)
   - Communication preferences
   - Output formatting requirements

> Custom Instructions is a powerful way to maintain consistency in your AI interactions and streamline your workflow according to your specific needs and preferences.
