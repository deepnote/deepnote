Deepnote natively integrates with a substantial collection of databases, data warehouses, and other services. All integrations are plug-and-play, meaning they can be connected to any project in the workspace they were created in on an as-needed basis (click [here](/docs/team-permissions) to read more about integration permissions).

Once created, integrations greatly simplify using Deepnote in conjunction with other tools in your data stack through, for instance, custom [SQL blocks](/docs/sql-cells). On top of all of that, Deepnote also takes care of credential management for you by encrypting and securely storing all integration-related credentials.

### Supported integrations

Missing an integration? [Let us know through Deepnote's Product Portal!](https://portal.productboard.com/deepnote/1-deepnote-product-portal/tabs/1-under-consideration/submit-idea)
</Callout>

Learn more about any of Deepnote's currently supported integrations by selecting a specific integration from the left-hand sidebar or browsing integrations by category and jumping into a detailed walkthrough of connecting and using integrations.

### Creating & managing integrations

To edit your existing integrations (and create new ones), open up the integrations overview from the left-hand sidebar. Alternatively, you can also find your way to the integrations overview via the integrations menu in the right-hand sidebar within each project.

As mentioned above, each integration can be connected to multiple projects within your workspace. It is important to remember that deleting an integration that is connected to multiple projects will remove the specified integration from all projects in that workspace.

<Callout status="info">
Some integrations require your machine to restart (don't fret, you will be warned in advance). Note that this will terminate all running processes in the project.
</Callout>

To keep an integration available in your workspace and only remove it from a specific project, open up the right-hand sidebar and edit the integration in question in the integrations menu.
