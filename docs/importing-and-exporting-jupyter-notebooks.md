## How to import`.ipynb` files

There are two ways to import `.ipynb` files into a Deepnote project:

1. Drag and drop `.ipynb` files into the **NOTEBOOKS** section in the left panel.

While we do our best to maintain compatibility with Jupyter, specialized blocks in Deepnote cannot be represented exactly in Jupyter (e.g., SQL, chart, input, and rich text blocks). Upon export, queries in SQL blocks will be converted to a string representation and rich text blocks will be converted to Markdown.
