Deepnote comes with code intelligence tools that are common in traditional IDEs. As you write code or SQL, we make it easy for you to focus on the problem at hand rather than having to memorize function signatures and other code-specific details.

#### Code autocomplete

As you type, we show you the relevant functions, methods, and defined variables. You can also trigger the autocomplete any time by hitting 'Tab' key.

#### Function documentation and parameter names

When you hover over a function, we surface its documentation if it is provided by the associated module. In addition, while filling out function parameters, you will see hints for the parameters you'll need. You can also trigger these hints by hitting <Keyboard>Shift + Tab</Keyboard>

#### SQL autocomplete

When writing SQL, the built-in _Intellisense_ will offer relevant suggestions for your cursor position. This includes entities in your schema such as databases, tables or columns but also aliases or CTEs that you may have defined in your query. The autocomplete will open automatically as you type. In addition to that, you can trigger it manually by using one of these keyboard shortcuts <Keyboard>Control + Space</Keyboard>, <Keyboard>Option + Space</Keyboard> or <Keyboard>âŒ˜ + I</Keyboard>
