## Chart AI

Not feeling like pointing and clicking today? We got you. As an alternative to manual setup, you can also ask Deepnote AI to create a chart for you. Open Chart AI by clicking **Chart AI** button on the top of the chart block, type in what you want to visualize, and hit **Submit**. In a few seconds, Deepnote AI will respond with a chart suggestion. You can accept it (**Done**) or reject (**Undo**) and adjust your description.

The accepted chart will have all the configurations filled out for you. You can use it as a starting point and manually tweak things further. You can also request follow-up edits from Deepnote AI by typing in a new prompt to modify your existing chart.
