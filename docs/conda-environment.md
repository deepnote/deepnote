[Anaconda Inc.](https://www.anaconda.com/) maintains a repository of thousands of curated packages for data science.

Deepnote comes with a pre-built conda environment which allows users to instantly take advantage of the Anaconda ecosystem. This includes being able to use condaâ€”a widely used CLI tool for package management which will include packages from the [Miniconda Installer](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).

## How to use the conda environment Deepnote

Simply select "Anaconda - Python 3.9" from Deepnote's environment dropdown (as shown below). You now have access to the pre-installed packages listed below as well the conda CLI.

### Installing packages from the Anaconda repository

Use the conda CLI from within the notebook to install packages. For example, to install Altair, type the following into a code block:

```python
!conda install altair
```

See this [template notebook](https://deepnote.com/workspace/deepnote-8b0ebf6d-5672-4a8b-a488-2dd220383dd3/project/Anaconda-Template-Weather-a2c95362-b4c4-4f22-8bc9-0b0f12ee5c34) for an example.

### Listing the installed packages in the conda environment

To list the currently installed packages, type the following into a code block:

```python
!conda list
```

### How does a `requirements.txt` file work with the conda environment?

Upon startup, Deepnote will install any packages listed in a `requirements.txt` file; however, currently `pip` will be used to install packages into the conda environment in this case.

### Which packages are pre-installed in the miniconda environment?
