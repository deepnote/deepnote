## 1. Self-serve

### Deepnote AI

Deepnote has powerful AI features which might solve the problem for you! It can generate blocks of code, or suggest fixes.

### ChatGPT

ChatGPT is a great resource for riffing on solving high-level challenges.

### Google

Googling is second nature to seasoned data scientists, perhaps not so much for beginners. Try searching the error message you're getting, or what you want to achieve.

## 2. We're here to help

### Support chat

Look for a question mark in the bottom right corner.

_While we do our best to reply promptly, we do also love our sleep. We will likely be able to reply to you within a few hours to a few days if you reach out to us via our support chat._

### Joint Slack channel

If you are on an Enterprise plan, look for Deepnote among your channels â€“ there's a good chance it's already there!
