Distribute your homework and assignments among your students, let them complete their tasks, and collect them back — all within the same environment.

Each of your workspaces has individual private spaces visible only to you. You can create multiple projects in this space and share each of them with individual students for individual assignments.

You can create as many private projects as you want, each dedicated to a single student. Once you create all of the desired projects, you can invite students individually by [sharing a project](/docs/share-projects). Since projects are located in a private section of the workspace, students will not be able to see each other's work.

Once your students complete their assignments, you can either [collect the work](/docs/submissions) or immediately check the progress by going directly into the project.
