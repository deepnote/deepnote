2\. After **creating** and **connecting** the integration, you can use Docker images from your private Docker Hub repository as a [custom environment](/docs/custom-environment) for your project.

**Your credentials are encrypted and securely stored in our database.** When you delete this integration, we also wipe your Docker Hub credentials from our systems.
