### Hardware options

Every project in Deepnote runs on a machine in the cloud. This means you don't need to worry about any kind of setup. Note that all hardware options have an enabled connection to the internet and therefore keep running even if you close your browser (also see [long-running jobs](/docs/long-running-jobs)).

At this moment Deepnote does not support connecting to your own cloud-based resource (e.g. AWS, GCP), but this is coming soon.

To choose a different machine for your project (and monitor you machine's performance), click the arrow next to "Environments" in the right sidebar. There you will see an option to change your machine if desired. More powerful machines are available on paid plans. See [Pricing](/docs/pricing) or contact us for details.
