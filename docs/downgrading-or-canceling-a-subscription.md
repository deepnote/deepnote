When you cancel your subscription or downgrade your plan, you will lose access to some features which are not available on the Free plan. Below we describe how each feature will be downgraded.

1. **Editor seats.** The workspace will revert to a member limit of 3. The most recently added admins and editors above this limit will be given Viewer permission.

1. **Projects.** You will keep all projects that are in your workspace. If the workspace has reached or exceeded the project limit of the Free tier, you will not be able to create any new projects.
1. **Folders.** The workspace will keep any existing folders, but new folders cannot be created.
1. **Revision history.** You will not be able to open any versions older than 7 days. They will still be visible in the Activity Log.
1. **Workspace member permissions.**
   - Any workspace members who are not Admins will be given Viewer permissions.
   - Any workspace members that join via an Editor invite link will join as Viewers.
1. **Project permissions.**

   - Any project public links with a permission that is not _Edit_, will be set to _View_.

1. **Published projects.** Any published projects that are shared with Workspace & collaborators will be unpublished. You can always publish these projects again with a different sharing settings.
1. **Team integrations.** Integrations that are not part of the Free plan will be disconnected from all projects. You will still be able to see these integrations, but you will not be able to connect them to your projects.
