## The challenges we're tackling

Teaching and learning data science is often harder than it needs to be. Deepnote helps learners and educators alike overcome common classroom challenges so they can focus on what matters most.

##### Remote teaching

Making sure everyone is on the same page can be difficult, especially in an online environment. Thanks to Deepnote’s real-time collaboration, educators can see what others are doing and keep them focused on the task at hand.

##### Classroom setup

Students typically lose precious time learning how to set up their environment by installing Python, Jupyter, and other necessary software. Deepnote is fully browser- based, which means students can get started instantly without any instructions. Just sign up, create your classroom, and invite your students.

##### Collaboration

Data science is a team sport. With Deepnote, students can work together in the same notebook. They can also be invited to your notebook as Viewers so they can follow along and ask questions.

##### Accessibility

Because Deepnote runs in the cloud, students don’t require powerful hardware. They can also access Deepnote from any computer, be it their personal laptop or a PC at their school's library.

## Features for teachers

Teaching data science doesn't have to be difficult. Here are some of the key features both students and instructors can count on.

##### Real-time collaboration

Deepnote offers real-time collaboration options (just like Google Docs), which simplifies both teaching and group projects. Collaborating in Deepnote is as easy as copy-pasting a URL.

##### Shared environments

Students can create duplicates of a lecturer’s notebook with the required environment already pre-set. No more time wasted on environment preparation.

##### Zero setup

Deepnote is fully browser-based and requires zero setups. No more fussing with terminals or package installations. You're ready to go in two clicks.

##### Comments & reviews

Provide assistance, leave feedback, or grade notebooks using comments. Receive notifications whenever a new comment is added.

##### Classroom management

Manage all classroom material — from lectures to assignments — all in one workspace. Customize permissions for students, instructors, and TAs to match your classroom structure.

##### Easy submissions

Deepnote allows all students to easily [export their work](/docs/submissions) into the desired format and submit all their assignments, homework, and group work to their instructors.

## Deepnote glossary

##### Workspace

[Workspaces](/docs/workspaces) are the home for all your notebooks. You can organize your notebooks in folders and create integrations that allow you to connect to your data. Once this is done, you can then access it from every notebook. You can also invite your classmates/colleagues to a workspace and collaborate together. In other words, a workspace is your classroom.

##### Folder

Deepnote helps you keep your work sorted and organized. Each Deepnote classroom can have multiple folders with many projects. Thanks to folders, you can divide your students into multiple teams while keeping them part of the same classroom.

##### Project

A project in Deepnote contains code and data, and it all runs in one environment. Each project can represent one lecture or class exercise.

##### Classroom

The space where all your projects, students, data, and integrations are located. A classroom can also be referred to in different terminology (i.e., [workspace](/docs/workspaces)).

##### Access levels

Deepnote has two access levels: project base, which only affects people in the same project as you, and workspace base, which affects all the members of the workspace. This feature gives the owner of the classroom more control. For more information, visit [workspace permissions.](/docs/team-permissions)
