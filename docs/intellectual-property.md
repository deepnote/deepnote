The code you write on Deepnote is yours and Deepnote does not make any ownership claims. If you make your project public (either by sharing it with friends or by making it accessible by link), the people you share with will be able to access your project and see your code. It is your responsibility to make sure this is ok.

If you are making the project public and sharing the link to it on some online platform (eg. a blog), we recommend you to include a LICENSE file to mitigate any possible disputes.
