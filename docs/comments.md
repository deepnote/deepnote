### Resolve or unresolve threads

Once you comment on a thread, you will be subscribed to that thread and get updates via email. When a discussion is finished, you can close or open a thread by clicking "resolve" or "unresolve", respectively.

In the Comments sidebar, use the toggle switches to search through previous resolved and unresolved comments. Clicking on a comment will take you to the associated block in the notebook.
