Slack is the collaboration hub that brings the right people, information, and tools together to get work done. In Deepnote, you can use the built-in integration for Slack to report on your scheduled notebook runs and keep you and your stakeholders up-to-date with the recent work. Deepnote lets you execute your notebooks on daily, weekly, or hourly basis. This is useful if you would like to process data or update a dashboard at a regular frequency.

Scheduling is available on Team and Enterprise plans.

## How to schedule a notebook and get notified in Slack

You can find the integration for Slack inside the Scheduling modal in each notebook.

1. Click the Scheduling button next to the **Run notebook** button at the top of your notebook
2. Configure the frequency at which you would like the notebook to run
3. Enable the **Send notification via Slack after run**
4. Slack authentication window will pop up, choose the right workspace and allow access for the Deepnote app.
5. Choose the channels or users you'd like to get notified about success or failure runs
6. Click **Save schedule**

Note that by default you will only see public channels of your workspace. If you'd like to send the messages to a private channel, add the Deepnote app inside Slack to the private channel, and you'll be able to send messages there as well.

If you wish to remove the auth pairing of your Slack and Deepnote workspaces, you can do it either from the Slack app directory, or you can navigate to **Settings & members** -> **Project settings** in your Deepnote workspace, and deselect the Slack notifications toggle.
