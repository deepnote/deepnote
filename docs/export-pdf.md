To export your notebook, follow these steps:

1. Open the notebook, and [create an app](/docs/creating-apps) from it by clicking the "Create app" button in the top right corner.
2. In the app editor, choose which blocks should be included in the PDF.
3. After you are done, open your app in a new tab by clicking on the "View app" button in the right sidebar.
4. Click on the "Export to PDF" button in the top right corner. This will open your browser's native print dialog to create the PDF. Elements like the top bar or sidebars are hidden in the printed version.
5. (Optional) Delete the app.
