##### Default groups

Deepnote provides a selection of pre-defined groups that can be used within your directory. When users are assigned to these groups, they are automatically assigned the corresponding role in Deepnote. Users who don’t belong to a group will be assigned the **Viewer** role. All currently supported groups are listed in the template below.

| IdP Group        | Deepnote role |
| ---------------- | ------------- |
| Deepnote Viewer  | Viewer        |
| Deepnote Editors | Editor        |
| Deepnote Admins  | Admin         |

For role assignment to work properly, users must be direct members of the group. This means that **nested groups are not supported**.

##### Custom groups
